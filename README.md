Sample code for implementing post-selection inference methods in the structured life course modeling approach.


`post-selection-inference.R`

The R code shows how the p-values and the confidence intervals of the post-selection inference methods compared in this study can be computed in R, where X_hypos is the design matrix, y the outcome, and npred the number of predictors.

The code accompanies the following manuscript:
